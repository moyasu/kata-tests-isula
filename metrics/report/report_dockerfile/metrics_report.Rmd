# Introduction
This report compares the metrics between multiple sets of data generated from
the [Kata Containers report generation scripts](github.com/kata-containers/tests/metrics/report/README.md).

This report was generated using the data from the **`r resultdirs`** results directories.

# Container PSS footprint
This [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/density/docker_memory_usage.sh)
measures the PSS footprint of all the container runtime components whilst running a number
of parallel containers. The results are the mean footprint proportion for a single
container.

```{r memory-footprint, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Memory PSS footprint"}
source('memory-footprint.R')
```
\pagebreak

# Container scaling system footprint
This [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/density/footprint_data.sh)
measures the system memory footprint impact whilst running an increasing number
of containers. For this test, [KSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_same-page_merging)
 is enabled. The results show how system memory is consumed for different sized
containers, and their average system memory footprint cost and density (how many
containers you can fit per Gb) is calculated.

```{r footprint-density, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="System Memory density"}
test_name_extra="-ksm"
source('footprint-density.R')
rm(test_name_extra)
```

# Memory used inside container
This [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/density/memory_usage_inside_container.sh)
measures the memory inside a container taken by the container runtime. It shows the difference between the amount of memory requested for the container, and the amount the container can actually 'see'.

The *% Consumed* is the key row in the table, which compares the *Requested* against *Total* values.


```{r mem-in-cont, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="System Memory density"}
source('mem-in-cont.R')
```
\pagebreak


# Container Docker boot lifecycle times
This [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/time/launch_times.sh)
uses the `date` command on the host and in the container, as well as data from the container
kernel `dmesg`, to ascertain how long different phases of the create/boot/run/delete
Docker container lifecycle take for the first launched container.

To decode the stats table, the prefixes are 'to(`2`)' and '`i`n'. The suffixes are '`k`ernel', '`w`orkload' and '`q`uit'. 'tot' is the total time for a complete container start-to-finished cycle.

```{r lifecycle-time, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Execution lifecycle times"}
source('lifecycle-time.R')
```

# Storage I/O

Measure storage I/O bandwidth, latency and IOPS using 
this [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/storage/fio.sh).

This test measures using separate random read and write tests.

## Reads

```{r fio-reads, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Storage I/O Reads", results='asis'}
source('fio-reads.R')
```

\pagebreak

## Writes

```{r fio-writes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Storage I/O Writes", results='asis'}
source('fio-writes.R')
```
\pagebreak

# Network CPU costs

Measure CPU costs whilst performing a fixed bandwidth container
to container network test using
this [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/master/metrics/network/cpu_statistics_iperf.sh).
As local container-to-container networking is a pure local software activity, this test
is a reasonable way to show changes in network stack processing costs.

```{r network-cpu, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Storage I/O Writes", results='asis'}
source('network-cpu.R')
```
\pagebreak

# Test setup details

This table describes the test system details, as derived from the information contained
in the test results files.


```{r dut, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="System configuration details"}
source('dut-details.R')
```
